# 📱 Mobile App Usage Behavior – EDA & Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project analyzes a subset of the **"Worldwide Mobile App User Behavior Dataset"** from **Harvard Dataverse**, comprising over **10,000 survey responses** from users in **15 countries**. The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior related to **how people find, download, and abandon mobile apps**. 

It's performed:
- Deep **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Unsupervised Learning** via **DBSCAN** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- An interactive **data storytelling presentation**

## 📊 Project Overview

The original dataset surveyed **10,208 people** across **15 countries**, including the USA, China, Japan, Germany, France, Brazil, UK, Italy, Russia, India, Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, and South Korea.

Survey content covered:
1. **Mobile App Usage Behavior**
   - App store preferences
   - Triggers for app searches
   - Reasons for downloading or abandoning apps
   - App categories downloaded
2. **Demographics**
   - Age, gender, education, income, nationality, etc.
3. **Psychographics**
   - **Big Five Personality Traits**

🔍 This project focuses **exclusively on mobile app usage behavior**, analyzing behavioral patterns and clustering user types using unsupervised machine learning.
As part of the applied use case, I created a **fictional mobile app prototype called “HiDriver”**, designed and prototyped in **Figma**, to help illustrate how insights from clustering could inform feature prioritization and user targeting.


> 🏆 This project was awarded **Best Data Analysis Project** in December 2024 during the final project competition of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona.
